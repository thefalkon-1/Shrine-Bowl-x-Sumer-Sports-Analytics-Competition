    "#### CELL 2: \"CONTACT ONSET\" DETECTION\n",
    "The rep detection algorithm already provides the start and end (disengagement) of each rep, but we now face a second segementation challenge: When did the \"contact onset\" point occur? Identifying the contact onset point is the first step identifying evaluation-style metrics, like closing speed, displacement (a proxy for power), bend, and more. The main challenge here is that there's no film to validate when the contact onset point occurred, so we must infer contact onset based on the available tracking data. (As such, the \"contact onset\" frame is a proxy for actual the contact onset point.) To do so, we'll go through a two-step process:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Engagement Window Detection**: It anchors on the closest OL–DL approach early in the rep and treats that as a contact proxy. It then walks backward to find when distance first stays under a matchup‑specific threshold and forward to find sustained separation/disengagement. This created rough per-rep lower and upper bounds for the engagement window and is used as a fallback for when contact onset detection identifies a contact onset point too late in the rep.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Contact Onset Point Detection**: It derives kinematic signals (closing speed, jerk, lateral accel) and runs a state machine that gates on proximity and shrinking pairwise distance (closing). It declares contact onset when two of three confirmation signals (closing speed collapse, coupling signature and jerk spike). In the vast majority of cases, closing speed collapse and coupling signature are the primary confirmation signals. A small quality control loop ensures that the contact onset point is never declared too late in the rep."

    "The gold standard for ground truth is validating the contact onset frame with the matching frame in the video. Since this is not possible, the next best approach with the available data is to manually infer the contact onset frame via carefully inspecting each rep. The following heuristics were used to identify a contact onset frame:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is the DL within a minimum distance threshold (<= 1 yard) of the OL?\n",
    "2. Is pairwise distance shrinking fast?\n",
    "3. Is the OL-DL near a local minimum in pairwise distance?\n",
    "4. Does the OL-DL pair act as one \"body\" (in terms of movement) near the contact onset frame? (More instructive for interior linemen compared to defensive ends and tackles.)\n",
    "\n",
    "A couple of caveats:\n",
    "1. The heuristics are not perfect but attempt to capture the essence of what these reps look like on film.\n",
    "2. The heuristics are not wholly independent from the algorithmic approach used to identify the contact onset frame, since the algorithmic approach uses many of the same heuristics in spirit. Ground truth for when contact onset actually occurred is not known, so the contact onset frame should be treated as a proxy or an estimate.\n",
    "\n",
    "With that being said, we can compare the differences between the manually identified contact onset frame with the algorithmically identified contact onset frame as a sanity check:\n",
